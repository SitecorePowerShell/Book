# Disclaimer

Since every environment is different, all code should not be run in a production environment without your team or organization thoroughly testing first. We recommend the use of a test lab environment often referred to as a development/staging instance of Sitecore.

The disclaimer is provided because someone somewhere will inevitably not follow this recommendation and if they do hose their Sitecore environment, they have no one to blame but themselves.
