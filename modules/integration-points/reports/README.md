# Reports

The reports which come out of the box provide a wide variety of information regarding your Sitecore installation.

We've built quite a few reports, many similar to the [Advanced System Report](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Book/tree/9c7126d7a38df6ef372e8baef52f9a02baabd550/modules/integration-points/reports/[https:/marketplace.sitecore.net/en/Modules/A/Advanced/_System/_Reporter.aspx]) \(ASR\) module.

## Running a Report

The custom reports can be found by navigating to _Sitecore -&gt; Reporting Tools -&gt; PowerShell Reports_.

As an example, let's run the Unused media items report.

Once the report completes, the results appear in a report window.

## Reports in SPE like ASR

While SPE contains many reports, they don't match identical to ASR reports. We've done our best to build those that seem most relevant or likely to be used. If you find a report in ASR that you would like to exist in SPE please submit a request.

## Reports Security

You may wish to expose the reports to users such as Content Authors. Here are the steps required to grant access to users in the `sitecore\Sitecore Client Authoring` role.

Here is what users may see in the event they do not have the appropriate access.

![Reports without Access](../../../.gitbook/assets/reports-menuwithoutaccess.png)

1. Navigate to the item `/sitecore/content/Documents and settings/All users/Start menu/Right/Reporting Tools/PowerShell Reports`
2. Grant access to `sitecore\Sitecore Client Authoring`

   ![Report Viewer Access](../../../.gitbook/assets/reports-vieweraccess.png)

3. Verify the reports are now visible to the Authoring users.

   ![Reports with Access](../../../.gitbook/assets/reports-menuwithaccess.png)

**Note:** In verson 6.4 the default access changed from  `sitecore\Sitecore Client Maintaining` to a lower privileged account `sitecore\Sitecore Client Authoring`.
