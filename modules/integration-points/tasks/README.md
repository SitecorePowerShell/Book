# Tasks

The task scheduler is a great way to run scripts in a periodic fashion. You may find the need to automatically archive log files into a compressed file. Perhaps send an email with a generated report based on stale site content.

## Scheduled Task Command

To help make the setup simple, we've provided a _Task Command_.

![PowerShell Script Command](../../../.gitbook/assets/tasks-powershellscriptcommand.png)

The command shown above is simply a type exposed as a public method in the _Spe_ assembly. There exists an update method which accepts one or more items and executes the associated script.

Beneath _Schedules_ you can create as many tasks as Sitecore will allow. Configure the _Command_ and _Items_ fields like that shown below.

The _Items_ field contains the path to a script in the _Script Library_.

Below are some of the scripts found out-of-the-box with SPE.

| Module | Script |
| :--- | :--- |
| System Maintenance | Archive Sitecore logs, Clean up deleted items older than 30 days |
| User Session Management | Remove idle user sessions |

## Create and Manage Tasks

We've added a context menu item to provide you with a shortcut to the Task Scheduler Editor.

Create a new scheduled task:

![Insert Option for Task](../../../.gitbook/assets/task-inserttask.png)

Run or edit the scheduled task:

![Run or Edit Task Schedule](../../../.gitbook/assets/task-runedittask.png)

The scheduled task is capable of running 1-to-many scripts. Choose all that apply for the selected task. Each script runs within a shared session, making it possible to share results between scripts.

**Note:** Make use of the **Enable Rule** to take advantage of the rules engine.

![Dialog to Select Task Scripts](../../../.gitbook/assets/task-createtaskwithscripts.png)

The task schedule has an intuitive dialog for working with and changing the frequency.

**Note:** Examples included are in the following modules

* License Expiration
* Media Library Maintenance
* System Maintenance
