## Examples

### EXAMPLE 1

Creates an access rule that allows the "sitecore\adam" user to delete the item to which it will be applied and all of its childre

```text
PS master:\> New-ItemAcl -AccessRight item:delete -PropagationType Any -SecurityPermission AllowAccess -Identity "sitecore\adam"

Account           AccessRight    PermissionType   PropagationType  SecurityPermission
-------           -----------    --------------   ---------------  ------------------
sitecore\admin    item:delete    Access           Any              AllowAccess
```

### EXAMPLE 2

Allows the "sitecore\adam" user to delete the Home item and all of its children. Denies the "sitecore\mikey" user reading the descendants of the Home item. ;P The security info is created prior to adding it to the item. The item is delivered to the Add-ItemAcl from the pipeline and returned to the pipeline after processing due to the -PassThru parameter. The security information is added to the previously existing security qualifiers.

```text
$acl1 = New-ItemAcl -AccessRight item:delete -PropagationType Any -SecurityPermission AllowAccess -Identity "sitecore\adam"
$acl2 = New-ItemAcl -AccessRight item:read -PropagationType Descendants -SecurityPermission DenyAccess -Identity "sitecore\mikey"
Get-Item -Path master:\content\home | Add-ItemAcl -AccessRules $acl1, $acl2 -PassThru

Name   Children Languages                Id                                     TemplateName
----   -------- ---------                --                                     ------------
Home   False    {en, ja-JP, de-DE, da}   {110D559F-DEA5-42EA-9C1C-8A5DF7E70EF9} Sample Item
```

### EXAMPLE 3

Allows the "sitecore\adam" user to delete the Home item and all of its children. Denies the "sitecore\mikey" user reading the descendants of the Home item. ;P The security info is created prior to setting it to the item. The item is delivered to the Set-ItemAcl from the pipeline and returned to the pipeline after processing due to the -PassThru parameter. Any previuous security information on the item is removed.

```text
$acl1 = New-ItemAcl -AccessRight item:delete -PropagationType Any -SecurityPermission AllowAccess -Identity "sitecore\adam"
$acl2 = New-ItemAcl -AccessRight item:read -PropagationType Descendants -SecurityPermission DenyAccess -Identity "sitecore\mikey"
Get-Item -Path master:\content\home | Set-ItemAcl -AccessRules $acl1, $acl2 -PassThru

Name   Children Languages                Id                                     TemplateName
----   -------- ---------                --                                     ------------
Home   False    {en, ja-JP, de-DE, da}   {110D559F-DEA5-42EA-9C1C-8A5DF7E70EF9} Sample Item
```
