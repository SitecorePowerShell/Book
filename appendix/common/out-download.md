# Out-Download

Send an object content to the client

## Syntax

Out-Download -InputObject &lt;Object&gt; \[-ContentType &lt;String&gt;\] \[-Name &lt;String&gt;\]

## Detailed Description

The cmdlet allows to send content of an object \(FileInfo, Stream, String, String\[\] or Byte\[\]\) to the client. This is used for example by report scripts to send the report in HTML, Json or Excel without saving the content of the object to the disk drive. You can specify an object type and file name to make sure the downloaded file is interpreted properly by the browser.
